### Collaborative Multi-Robot Task Planning Using Large Language Models
**January 2025 – June 2025 | Master's Thesis | Uppsala University**  

Explored the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in static warehouse environments for multi-robot collaboration. Focused on task decomposition, efficient allocation, and coordination in item retrieval and sorting tasks.

#### Key Contributions:
- Prepared structured datasets and developed simulation environments to evaluate LLM-generated task plans.
- Implemented and analyzed LLM-based task planning methods, focusing on task efficiency and collaboration metrics.
- Provided insights into LLMs’ potential to enhance warehouse automation through detailed performance analysis.
